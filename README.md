# MazeGenerator
Hello, this is a little algorithm that creates a maze. I've implemented it in p5, alongside a [tutorial from Daniel Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4).
The one significant improvement I've made on the original program is that I've made the maze playable. You can control it with the arrow keys. It's pretty fun.

## Requirements
- A modern web browser, preferably Chrome.

## How to change the difficulty
- In `main.js`, change the variable `w` however you want.
- This will change the number of separations.
